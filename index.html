			</nav>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hamm's Passer is a browser game based on the classsic Bally Arcade cabinet, "Tapper", a game where you play a bartender that slides beers down a bar to customers. As opposed to using draft beers like the original game I chose cans of Hamm's as the beer of choice. Hamm's was the staff beer at the restarurant I worked for several years. Speaking from expericence, Hamm's always tastes better after being slid down a bar.</p>

			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The game runs using the HTML canvas element utilizing animation frames. The game can run in any web browser as long as it's big enough to hold the canvas element = 800px by 800px It can be run on other systems as well as long as the screen size can be changed.</p>
